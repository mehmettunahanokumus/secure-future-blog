Phishing remains the #1 attack vector for cybercriminals, and it's getting more sophisticated every day. In 2025, over 90% of successful data breaches start with a phishing email. Understanding how these attacks work is your first line of defense.

## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a social engineering attack where criminals impersonate trusted entities to trick victims into revealing sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or downloading malware. The name comes from "fishing" — attackers cast a wide net hoping to catch unsuspecting victims.

## Types of Phishing Attacks

### 1. Email Phishing

The most common form of phishing. Attackers send mass emails that appear to come from legitimate organizations:

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your name
- Urgent language creating fear or excitement
- Suspicious sender email addresses (look closely!)
- Grammar and spelling errors
- Requests for sensitive information
- Links that don't match the supposed sender

**Example:** An email claiming to be from your bank saying "Your account has been locked. Click here to verify your identity." The link leads to a fake banking site designed to steal your credentials.

### 2. Spear Phishing

Targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations. Attackers research their victims to create highly personalized messages.

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Uses personal information (job title, colleague names, recent activities)
- References real projects or events
- Appears to come from known contacts
- Much harder to detect than generic phishing

**Example:** An email appearing to be from your CEO asking you to urgently wire funds for a confidential acquisition, referencing a real board meeting that happened last week.

### 3. Whaling

Spear phishing attacks specifically targeting C-suite executives and other high-profile targets. The stakes are higher, and attackers invest significant effort in research.

### 4. Smishing (SMS Phishing)

Phishing attacks delivered via text messages. With more business happening on mobile devices, smishing is rapidly growing.

**Common Tactics:**
- Fake delivery notifications from UPS, FedEx, Amazon
- Bank account alerts
- COVID-related scams
- Government impersonation

### 5. Vishing (Voice Phishing)

Phone calls from attackers pretending to be from Microsoft support, the IRS, your bank, or other trusted entities.

**Warning Signs:**
- Unsolicited calls about security issues
- Pressure to act immediately
- Requests for remote access to your computer
- Demands for gift cards or cryptocurrency

### 6. AI-Powered Phishing

The newest and most concerning evolution. Attackers now use AI to:

- **Generate flawless text** without the grammar errors that traditionally gave phishing away
- **Create deepfake videos and audio** of executives
- **Personalize attacks at scale** using data harvested from social media
- **Adapt in real-time** to victim responses

## How Modern Phishing Campaigns Work

### The Kill Chain

1. **Reconnaissance** — Attackers research targets using LinkedIn, social media, and data breaches
2. **Weaponization** — Creating convincing phishing emails, fake websites, and malware
3. **Delivery** — Sending phishing messages through email, SMS, or social media
4. **Exploitation** — Victim clicks a link or opens an attachment
5. **Installation** — Malware is deployed or credentials are harvested
6. **Command & Control** — Attackers establish persistent access
7. **Actions on Objectives** — Data theft, ransomware deployment, or financial fraud

### The Credential Harvesting Process

When you click a phishing link:

1. You're redirected to a fake login page that looks identical to the real one
2. When you enter credentials, they're sent to the attacker's server
3. The page may redirect you to the real site (you don't notice anything wrong)
4. Your credentials are used immediately or sold on the dark web
5. Attackers attempt password reuse across other services

## Defending Against Phishing

### Technical Controls

**For Individuals:**
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on all accounts
- Use a **password manager** with unique passwords for each site
- Keep **browsers and operating systems updated**
- Use **email services with strong spam filtering**
- Install **browser extensions** that warn about phishing sites

**For Organizations:**
- Deploy **email security gateways** with advanced threat protection
- Implement **DMARC, DKIM, and SPF** to prevent email spoofing
- Use **Security Awareness Training** platforms with phishing simulations
- Enable **conditional access policies** for sensitive applications
- Deploy **endpoint detection and response (EDR)** solutions

### Human-Centric Defenses

**The SLAM Method:**
- **S**ender — Is the email from who it claims to be?
- **L**inks — Hover before clicking. Does the URL match?
- **A**ttachments — Were you expecting this file?
- **M**essage — Does the content make sense? Is there urgency?

**When in Doubt:**
- Don't click links in emails — navigate directly to websites
- Call the supposed sender using a number you look up (not one in the email)
- Forward suspicious emails to your IT/security team
- Report phishing attempts to help protect others

## What to Do If You've Been Phished

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Change your password** for the affected account immediately
2. **Enable MFA** if it's not already active
3. **Change passwords** for any accounts using the same password
4. **Check for unauthorized activity** in your accounts
5. **Report the incident** to your IT department
6. **Monitor your credit** if financial information was exposed

### Long-term Steps:

- Review privacy settings on social media
- Be extra vigilant for follow-up attacks
- Consider a credit freeze if sensitive data was exposed
- Update security questions and recovery options

## The Bottom Line

Phishing attacks succeed because they exploit human psychology, not just technology. The best defense combines:

✅ **Strong technical controls** — MFA, email filtering, EDR
✅ **Security awareness** — Regular training and phishing simulations
✅ **Healthy skepticism** — If something seems off, verify through another channel
✅ **Incident response** — Know what to do if you make a mistake

Remember: **Attackers only need to succeed once. You need to be vigilant every time.**
