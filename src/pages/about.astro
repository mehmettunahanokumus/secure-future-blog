	<p>
		I work in cybersecurity and information security, but it’s more than just a job for me — I genuinely
		enjoy digging into how technology works, where it’s headed, and how it can go wrong. I’m the kind
		of person who falls down rabbit holes on AI models, security tools, or some weird tech concept I
		randomly come across, just because I want to understand it.
	</p>

	<p>
		This blog is basically my place to think out loud. I write about cybersecurity, technology, AI,
		and whatever else I’m exploring at the moment. Some posts are practical, some are just me
		connecting ideas, and some are there because I felt like chasing a thought until it made sense.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you’re into tech, learning, or just following someone’s curiosity in real time, you’ll feel at
		home here. And even if you’re not, at least you’ll get an honest look at how I see the world and
		the field I work in.
